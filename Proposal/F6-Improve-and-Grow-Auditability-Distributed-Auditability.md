##  F6: Improve and Grow Auditability - Distributed Auditability

### Problem statement :

No common audit standards in funded proposals.

No consistent evaluation of funded proposals.

Funded reporting is manual.

### Describe your solution to the problem

Identify common community standards.

Incentivize and ease evaluation

Automate funded proposal reporting.

### Relevant experience

### Detailed plan (not required) - Fill in here any additional details

#### Build an automated distributed auditability system.

At its heart Project Catalyst is an experiment to develop distributed governance for the Cardano blockchain. So, meeting the challenge to improve and grow auditability requires a distributed approach. An effective and equitable distribution of auditability will require connections between the funded proposer and the community to be established, the communal development of transparent audit methods and constant iteration. 

#### Relevant experience (identifying information)

Stephen Whitenstall has 30 years' experience in organizing academic, community and business projects. He develops, maintains documentation and provides technical project management support for Catalyst Swarm.

In Fund 5 of Project Catalyst Stephen's QA-DAO (https://stephen-rowan.gitbook.io/quality-assurance-dao/) submitted a proposal "Quality Assurance DAO" in the Developer Ecosystem Challenge that was funded in August 2021.

Stephen provides support to Catalyst Swarm by documenting and tracking it's activities. This has been done continuously since 7th July 2021 by raising GitHub issues that track Core Swarm Activities such as meetings, After Town Halls, events (Idea Fest) and Saturday Swarm Sessions. The evolution of the governance of Catalyst Swarm is documented and updated here - https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-swarm-genesis/governance/overview .

#### Roadmap

#### The present – Fund 5 QA-DAO proposal and community collaborations.

In August 2021 the F5: Developer ecosystem proposal Quality-Assurance-DAO ( https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Quality-Assurance-DAO/351678-48088 ) was successful in receiving votes and was funded. This confirmed that voters wish to see Quality Assurance Implemented in Project Catalyst and provides support for this proposal.

#### Phase 0 : Prior to Funding - Research and prototyping – present to November 2021

Research

How different teams and individuals report the progress of their funded proposals will be researched.

This Fund 6 Auditability proposal will draw upon the successful Fund 5 Developer ecosystem proposal for research. This will be done in collaboration with the funded cohort, IOG and Catalyst ecosystem toolmakers such as Catalyst Swarm.

Lessons Learnt to date

The ongoing experience of working with a widely distributed team such as Catalyst Swarm, working on many different projects, has led to automation solutions such as Issue templates and forms.

Qualitative lessons have also been learnt within Catalyst Swarm in respect of the amount of reporting and tracking required. In terms of what is manageable and what is meaningful to team members. The best incentive is a team understanding of who contributes what to a project - so that work is fairly attributed and costed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Phase 1 - Funded Proposal - November 2021 to February 2022

Continuous Integration Development

Once funded Distributed Auditability will build upon lessons learnt in Research and prototyping to automate reporting & tracking using Continuous Integration tools such as GitHub Actions.

Building on prototypes from Phase 0 specific auditing workflows will be automated using GitHub Actions.

Auditability Workflows

The data from funded cohort reporting and qualitative research (into how reporting varies) will inform the design of auditability workflows. An auditability workflow will model the working practices of participants, the metrics they report on, whether this fit into their own documentation and how they might benefit from automation.

Auditability Workshops

A related proposal Open-Source-Training ( F6: DLT Entrepreneurship Toolbox proposal ( https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Open-Source-Training/368678-48088 ) offered in collaboration with the Catalyst School will will offer workshops to assist early stage entrepreneurs in discovering their workflows and examining how these may be documented, reported on and automated.
