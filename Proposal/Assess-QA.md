#### Feasibility Note

The proposer possesses the experience to deliver this project and is already an established member of the community focusing on these issues. There is a well presented plan and it is highly likely the proposer will deliver on it given their experience in the area and energy already devoted to these aims.

#### Impact / Alignment Note

This proposal will have a great impact on developing a solution that will create an auditable solution for all future proposals within Catalyst.  It will leverage existing work done by the Catalyst Swarm to enable an infrastructure set up to be able to audit and monitor the progress of projects through a distributed network.  Utilizing Discord as well with pull and push requests to send notifications will make the project transparent to everyone.

#### Feasibility Note

Stephen has many years of experience, strong ties and understanding of the Cardano network and technology that underlies eveyrthing.  His experience with the Swarm and understanding of Discord, GitHub, and other peripheral systems will work to make the proposed solution work.  The roadmap, deliverables, and KPIs for the project are clearly laid out and visible.

#### Impact / Alignment Note

"Development of audit standards is important in ensuring auditability and quality of proposals. It is unclear what the whole scope of these standards will be. Proposer should give a clearer idea on what the standards seek to achieve. Normally audit standards give pre-defined rules on how to classify certain asset classes and how these are reported in yearly financial statement. The standards like IFRS and GAAP help auditors audit the financial statements prepared by financial controllers. 

I would expect that such standards seek to conformitise reporting between different proposals (at least in the same challenge bracket).
The second part of the proposal talks about tracking reporting for all the proposals in order to evaluate and analyse their performance. This is also highly beneficial for Catalyst although attaining automated reporting seems more difficult. So basically, the proposers will have to build in some sort of automatic reporting which gathers data/information from the server and sends it automatically to the community for assessment. GitHub actions is mentioned as one solution. So this means that automated reporting would be limited to those challenges having to do with program development on GitHub. 

The third goal of the proposal is about 'build(ing) consistent evaluation tools', however, there is very limited information in this regard. The proposer should define this term further."

#### Feasibility Note

The proposer declares that he has ample experience in organising projects, technical knowledge from working with IBM and QA mgt with a renowned bank. However, someone with auditory skills is required to help set the reporting standards and to produce yearly reports and comparisons. The proposer also seems to be well known in the community which might give him access to the remaining talents needed. The propose should indicate that the plan presented will mainly have an effect on certain challenges involving use of programming.

#### Auditability Note

"The project will have to deliver on various criteria. It has to provide a workable solution for automated reporting. No quality metrics have been set for such a solution (-level of information reported - frequency -results achiever from automatically reported information) as probably these are not yet known.

The project also ahs to create audit standards for proposals which is not clearly defined how this will be done and the scope of such standards. More information would be useful on this aspect. It is unclear where time is allocated to develop these standards. Finally, it would be hard to assess the quality of the standards developed and their final effect on proposal success.

There is limited information on the third goal and thus it is hard to assess. One metric talks about quality of performance, achievements & financials reports using the tools, but it is unclear who will assess the quality and what is considered as high quality or low quality. There might be unsuccessful proposals which have bad assessments regardless of using the tools mentioned or not."

"Excelent and simple idea. It will help to standarize the auditability process and give more transparency to it. The proposal is also very clear, with a clear implementation plan (divided into phases and with a schedule) and a scope. the problem is also clear and all the community would benefit from it.

The only thing to be careful here is to give some flexbility to funded proposers, as each project has its own specificity and not to burden them exhausting reports and beurocracy. This standars should be created together with the community, with a proper governance.  The right tool could certainly adress these problem and other proposals, at least in Fund6, contemplates that. Maybe consider working together."

#### Feasibility Note

"Although experienced, Proprosers qualification are not very clear and maybe more than 1 people working on it (2-3 should be good) could be posiive just to give more different points of view on this project, which I think its a must in ideas like this, where you indtend to standarize processess. 

The plan looks fair and budget break is clear. However, it only considers payment for hours but the are extra costs that should be considered as marketing and possible equipment purchase, if necessary."

#### Auditability Note

"There are a clear roadmap and kpis, however, they have  no targets - which is thge main reason for not getting a 5 stars here.

This project also has some risks on the regard of the acceptance of the standarization method from funded proposers but it is somehow addresed here in the project phases (specially in the workshop and in the collaborative way it seems it will be executed)."
