#### Impact / Alignment Note

This proposal will have a great impact on developing a solution that will create an auditable solution for all future proposals within Catalyst.  It will leverage existing work done by the Catalyst Swarm to enable an infrastructure set up to be able to audit and monitor the progress of projects through a distributed network.  Utilizing Discord as well with pull and push requests to send notifications will make the project transparent to everyone.

#### Impact / Alignment Note

"Development of audit standards is important in ensuring auditability and quality of proposals. It is unclear what the whole scope of these standards will be. Proposer should give a clearer idea on what the standards seek to achieve. Normally audit standards give pre-defined rules on how to classify certain asset classes and how these are reported in yearly financial statement. The standards like IFRS and GAAP help auditors audit the financial statements prepared by financial controllers. 

I would expect that such standards seek to conformitise reporting between different proposals (at least in the same challenge bracket).
The second part of the proposal talks about tracking reporting for all the proposals in order to evaluate and analyse their performance. This is also highly beneficial for Catalyst although attaining automated reporting seems more difficult. So basically, the proposers will have to build in some sort of automatic reporting which gathers data/information from the server and sends it automatically to the community for assessment. GitHub actions is mentioned as one solution. So this means that automated reporting would be limited to those challenges having to do with program development on GitHub. 

The third goal of the proposal is about 'build(ing) consistent evaluation tools', however, there is very limited information in this regard. The proposer should define this term further."

#### Feasibility Note

The proposer declares that he has ample experience in organising projects, technical knowledge from working with IBM and QA mgt with a renowned bank. However, someone with auditory skills is required to help set the reporting standards and to produce yearly reports and comparisons. The proposer also seems to be well known in the community which might give him access to the remaining talents needed. The propose should indicate that the plan presented will mainly have an effect on certain challenges involving use of programming.

#### Auditability Note

"The project will have to deliver on various criteria. It has to provide a workable solution for automated reporting. No quality metrics have been set for such a solution (-level of information reported - frequency -results achiever from automatically reported information) as probably these are not yet known.

The project also ahs to create audit standards for proposals which is not clearly defined how this will be done and the scope of such standards. More information would be useful on this aspect. It is unclear where time is allocated to develop these standards. Finally, it would be hard to assess the quality of the standards developed and their final effect on proposal success.

There is limited information on the third goal and thus it is hard to assess. One metric talks about quality of performance, achievements & financials reports using the tools, but it is unclear who will assess the quality and what is considered as high quality or low quality. There might be unsuccessful proposals which have bad assessments regardless of using the tools mentioned or not."

#### Impact / Alignment Note

"Excelent and simple idea. It will help to standarize the auditability process and give more transparency to it. The proposal is also very clear, with a clear implementation plan (divided into phases and with a schedule) and a scope. the problem is also clear and all the community would benefit from it.

The only thing to be careful here is to give some flexbility to funded proposers, as each project has its own specificity and not to burden them exhausting reports and beurocracy. This standars should be created together with the community, with a proper governance.  The right tool could certainly adress these problem and other proposals, at least in Fund6, contemplates that. Maybe consider working together."

#### Feasibility Note

"Although experienced, Proprosers qualification are not very clear and maybe more than 1 people working on it (2-3 should be good) could be posiive just to give more different points of view on this project, which I think its a must in ideas like this, where you indtend to standarize processess. 

The plan looks fair and budget break is clear. However, it only considers payment for hours but the are extra costs that should be considered as marketing and possible equipment purchase, if necessary."

#### Auditability Note

"There are a clear roadmap and kpis, however, they have  no targets - which is thge main reason for not getting a 5 stars here.

This project also has some risks on the regard of the acceptance of the standarization method from funded proposers but it is somehow addresed here in the project phases (specially in the workshop and in the collaborative way it seems it will be executed)."

### z_assessor_318

#### Impact / Alignment Note

"The proposal suggests an approach which is likely to benefit the current challenge goals. The proposal describes how continuous integration will help make funded proposals more efficient in reporting their goals.  

My main issue with the proposal is that it does not clearly indicate the limitations, or how it will overcome the limitations, of the method that is proposed. As a software developer, I can see very well how continuous integration would streamline reporting on metrics like number of commits and features implemented, but i'm having trouble imagining other metrics, such as user feedback or application usage, as they are not built-in to the code in the repository. However, it is not necessarily be a problem, as the goal is not to solve all reporting issues, I just wish the limitations were a bit more clearly explained."

#### Feasibility Note

The team seems to have appropriate expertise in the field, and has clearly defined the goals of the proposal, which is helping funded proposals make their reporting easier and faster. The proposer has a phase 0 which takes place before funding, which means he intends to put in work even before funding gets approved, which increases my confidence that he is committed to the project.

#### Impact / Alignment Note

The proposal is focussed on improving auditability via the creation of a system which increases transparency whilst also enables comparability between reviews of proposals. This will lead to more certainty of the learnings from the reviews. It will also assist better reviews to occur prior to funding being approved.

### Feasibility Note

It is clear that the Idea Submitter knows what he is talking about. As background I have a Masters in Social Science plus a law degree so have some experience of the importance of standards and how it is important to apply standards of auditing equally to allow system participants to benefit from funding and to feel that they have been treated fairly. I have assisted many teams to apply for research grants in the past. The proposal sets out a clear plan of activity on how to implement the proposal. This is impressive. That said it will be challenging.

### Feasibility Rating

#### Auditability Note

Given the clear timetable of activities both in terms of the activities which are described and the timeliness it will be possible to understand if a deliverable is achieved by a given date. The overall success will be auditable via an assessment of the outputs. I expect this will be possible to do as the stated goals will either be achieved, partly achieved or not achieved and this will be possible to review, provided that the access to information on project outcomes is made available.

This proposal fit into the challenge but the solution is not clear enough on what will be deliver at the end of the project , The project seem to use 3 month to build continuous Integration with Github Action. I believe the timeframe is too long to build only github action. It appear this is a research project and given that Catalyst funded project comes in all form , The Proposer have not convince me how Github action will improve distributed audibility to the benefit of the ecosystem , for that i score 2

"The proposal provided the following Key Metrics to measure

- Number of funded proposals using the automated auditability workflow tools.
 
- Number of commits in funded proposal repositories (Github)
 
- Quality of performance, achievements & financials reports using the tools compared to those not using them.

 - Number of onboarded developers using Continuous Integration

1. The first point is not sufficient to audit this project because the number of funded Proposals is track on the Ideascale and Catalyst Project already.
2. Number of commits in funded proposal github repo is not also enough because Catalyst project comes in various form , some project does not require any  github repo.

Based on the information provided , I score 2

"Has the problem needing to be solved been identified and articulated?

Yes.  The problem is clearly stated as 
There are no common audit standards in funded proposals.There is no consistent evaluation of funded proposals, either in terms of frequency ( 1 evaluation per quarter etc) or quality ( no estbalished standards of tracking and reporting.)

Funded reporting is manual.Each time can do as and when they wish.

Does this proposal fall within the scope of the challenge brief?

Yes. It has to do with Improving Auditablity  by identifying common community standards and building consistent tools. 

Does this proposal show clearly how it will add value to the Cardano System?
It states that since Cardano is a community, and Catalyst is built to distribute governance for Cardano Blockchain, then it follows that auditability also should be distributed.

Have key metrics and goals of the proposal been stated clearly?
The goals have been stated clearly. Namely to idenfity common community standards, build consistent evaluation tools and automate reporting.


Do the key metrics and goals of the proposal fall within the scope of the challenge
Yes they do

Can the proposal scale to address future challenges?
It can provided the tools are designed to scale up and the standards built on a framework allowing scaling.

In summary this more than comprehensively meets the criteria for impact."

"The plan is very well documented. The links and repositories are not very clear and there is no code in the Github as far as I have seen apart from some random config yml files and a few htmls, but that is OK at this stage.

What is a little bit concerning is that the proposer has so many other proposals in Fund 6 but this seems to be a high priority.
Reading through the comments in this and the last funded project this seems like a genuine and structured approach to achieving QA and traceability.
I would have liked to see more clear presentation in the proposal of the achievements of the last funded round (although that was a mere $5 so not sure how much one can expect)."

#### Impact / Alignment Note

Right from the start, the author of the proposal succinctly and efficiently explains to us the key issues involved in the analysis of proposals approved in the Catalyst project. The lack of a standard in the audit, in addition to the irregularity of such reviews, are really very relevant points, which the author cites from the beginning in his presentation, claiming that he will solve them. It is good that the proposal author builds on a previously successful proposal to chart paths for their project. As I understand it, this model proposal is a so-called QA-DAO (Fund 5 Developer ecosystem). It is interesting that it provides a link to the proposal, so that people who do not know it could have easier and faster access. The impact of this proposal is already identifiable, taking into account that a series of models and forms about the problems of the proposals and activities that involve them are already circulating, through tools such as GitHub Actions. The author conveys security in this information, passing up to the exact date on which these activities began. For this reason, I believe that the proposal dialogues very well with the objectives of the challenge, which are mainly to monitor the progress of financed projects and ensure that these data reach the members of the community. This can be seen clearly in the excerpt: "An auditability workflow will model the working practices of the participants, the metrics they report on, whether this fits into their own documentation, and how they can benefit from automation." If this promise is fulfilled, success with the challenge objectives is certain.

Regarding the author's ability to deliver what he promises, we have a satisfactory amount of information about him. We know that he has experience in managing projects, academic, business or community and also some projects he managed, about what they were about and where they happened (some in Catalyst itself). His actions are tracked very accurately, that is, we know what he has been doing, in which part of Catalyst (Town Halls, for example) and since when, with dates. His linkedin profile is also attached, where we can get to know more intimately who Stephen is, what his professional background and other places where he has worked. In this way, a lot of confidence is passed in their ability to carry out the present proposal.

#### Auditability Note

The author of the proposal provides us with a great deal of information about auditability. We know what will happen, according to phases, and the actions of each phase are very detailed. Furthermore, they are situated in time so that we can know exactly when they will happen. We are also given what the definition of success would be like, how the community can accurately track the progress of the project and whether everything is going as planned. The division of funding money is also extremely detailed, including information even on how many hours each activity will last (a very rare thing to find in the proposal description). Everything is very well explained, from how the project's publicity will happen, through which media channels it will happen, as well as the technical development, through updates on github. For these reasons, I believe the auditability is perfect, there is nothing to criticize. Through the information given, we can have a solid visualization of what will happen, when and for what purpose.
